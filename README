Green Apples is a repository for Mac OS X plugins, themes and
applications that don't deserve their own repository but that
should be shared with everyone! Current projects are:


Growlvetica
-----------
A simple Helvetica-based Growl style.


growl4itunes
------------
A Python script that sends notifications to Growl with the
minimum information about the current track on iTunes. It's
fairly customizable, if you know a bit about Python and
Applescript. I created this because Growltunes isn't customizable
at all. Maybe one day I'll make this customizable.


localize.py
-----------
This script generates Localized.strings files from XCode based projects.
Additionally, it merges the new translation files with the previous
translations, in case there is need to translate the application in
several steps of its development.
