growl4itunes
------------
A Python script that sends notifications to Growl with the
minimum information about the current track on iTunes. It's
fairly customizable, if you know a bit about Python and
Applescript. I created this because Growltunes isn't customizable
at all. Maybe one day I'll make this customizable.

Requirements:
    - Python
    - growlnotify (install from the Growl's distribution .dmg file)

Installation:
    - Put the file growl4itunes into your favourite scripts folder
      and configure it to start at boot time.
